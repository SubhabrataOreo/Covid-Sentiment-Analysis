# Covid-Sentiment-Analysis
Analysed sentiments of common people during lockdown to get some inferences about the upcoming Second Wave/Third Wave.
2020 is the year to be remembered for the Covid-19 pandemic all around the world. Currently the stats say over 50 million people have been reported positive till date with approx. 1.3 million deaths. While America is leading in the count, India is just following them. Realising the point of concern, we are heading to analyse the thoughts of Indians regarding this lethal pandemic and are going to co-relate the results of our research with the counts to get some important insights. Our primary approach will be to collect as much data as we can so that the result can depict the exact story. Then we will incorporate the Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to analyse the sentiment and make classification models respectively to get the actual picture of Indian society and the impact of that upon the current scenario. Hopefully this research work will be helpful to depict certain important issues and will help to take certain steps based on that, so that the possibility of the “Second Wave” of this pandemic can be handled properly.
